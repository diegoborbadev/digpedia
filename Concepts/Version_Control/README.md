# Introduction 
**Version control** (a.k.a. **revision control**, **source control**, or **source code management**) is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 

This practice allows you to **have a clear view of the changes made to the code over time**, and also **allows you to revert the code** to a previous state, if necessary.

In bigger contexts, code versioning **allows multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work**, and of course, helps in **separating code versions**.
