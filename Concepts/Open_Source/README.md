# Introduction 
Open source software is software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to **use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose**. 

Today the concept of *open source* is often extended beyond software, to represent a philosophy of collaboration in which working materials are made available online for anyone to fork, modify, discuss, and contribute to.
