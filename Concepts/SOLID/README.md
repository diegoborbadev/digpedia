# What is SOLID?
The *SOLID* principles were introduced by *Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)*  in his 2000 paper [*Design Principles and Design Patterns*](https://staff.cs.utu.fi/~jounsmed/doos_06/material/DesignPrinciplesAndPatterns.pdf), they are:

-**S**RP: [*The single-responsibility principle*](SRP.MD)  
-**O**CP: [*The open-closed principle*](OCP.md)  
-**L**SP: [*The Liskov substitution principle*](LSP.md)  
-**I**SP: [*The interface segregation principle*](ISP.md)  
-**D**IP: [*The dependency inversion principle*](DIP.md)  

They are a set of five principles that help us to write better code, they are not rules, but guidelines that **help us to write code that is easier to maintain, understand and extend**.
