# Liskov Substitution Principle
## What is LSP?
The *Liskov Substitution Principle* states that **objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclass without affecting the functionality of the program**. In other words, a subclass should override the methods of the superclass in a way that does not break the functionality of the program.
