# Servlet
A servlet is simply a class which responds to a particular type of network request - most commonly an *HTTP* request. Basically servlets are usually used to implement web applications - but there are also various frameworks which operate on top of servlets (e.g. [*Struts*](Struts/README.md)) to give a higher-level abstraction than the "here's an *HTTP* request, write to this *HTTP* response" level which servlets provide.

Servlets run in a servlet container which handles the networking side (e.g. parsing an *HTTP* request, connection handling etc). One of the best-known open source servlet containers is [*Tomcat*](Apache%20Tomcat/README.md).
